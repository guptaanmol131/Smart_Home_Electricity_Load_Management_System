# Smart Home Electricity Load Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize electricity consumption in a smart home. The goal is to optimize energy usage, monitor appliance efficiency, and compare power sources (solar vs. grid). The project uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

Timestamp: Time of energy usage

Total Energy (kWh): Total electricity consumed

Appliance: The device consuming power

Source: Energy source (Solar/Grid)

Battery Level (%): Charge level of the battery

Inverter Output (kW): Power supplied by the inverter

📊 Visualizations

The project includes:

1️⃣ Energy Usage Trends (Line Chart)

Shows electricity consumption over time

Helps identify peak usage hours

2️⃣ Power Source Contribution (Pie Chart)

Compares Solar vs. Grid power usage

Helps understand reliance on renewable energy

3️⃣ Hourly Energy Usage (Heatmap)

Visualizes energy usage at different times of the day

Helps optimize energy consumption habits

4️⃣ Appliance-Wise Consumption (Bar Chart)

Shows which appliances consume the most power

Helps in identifying high-energy appliances

5️⃣ Battery & Inverter Efficiency (Dual Line Chart)

Tracks battery charge levels and inverter efficiency

Helps optimize energy storage and usage

6️⃣ Correlation Matrix (Heatmap)

Finds relationships between different energy parameters

Helps in data-driven decision-making

🛠 Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Install dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Run the visualization script in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add real-time monitoring of power consumption

Implement predictive analysis for energy optimization

Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly/Streamlit
